# Git Command

## Git initial the Git repo

`git init`

by this command git now will follow you directories so u can see all them .

`git add .`

adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.

`git status`

To view the status of the git repository what kind directory did not saving in it .

---

`git commit -m "init"`

To save the changes with message in it .

---

`git branch -M main`

a lightweight movable pointer to [a commit]. The default branch name in Git is master. As you initially make commits.

---

`git remote add origin url.git`

To save the remote url to origin so we'll push the code to it

---

`git push -u origin main`

TO push all the code to the repo

`git clone url.git`

To download and save the file to your local machine .


# Lesson-6 

We take these topics 

- Data types => Number(integer,float), String(char,string), Boolean(true,false).
- String
- Logical & Comparison Operators.
- Variables
- Math => Math.sqrt , Math.sin, Math.Pow ....
- If Condition => both The nested If and ?.
- Loop => for, while and Do..while.
- Switch.

## Next Lesson 
+ Arrays 
  + we used to put many items in different variables and if we use arrays we could store many datatypes in one variable.
  + we can declare array with this Example :
    1. This the first way is official way :

                `let x = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`
    2. the second way is not official :
      
                  `let x = new Array(1,2,3,4,5,6)`
      - We can push Item's to end of the array using :
      
                  `x.push(item)`
      - Or we Can shift(Add item to start) Item using:
                  `x.shift(item)`
+ Object
  + is a set of values inside one variable .
  + the object we use if we want to call any value in it using the key in the object like :

          `let item = {id:1,name:"aLi"...etc}`
+ Functions
  + It's a set of block of code we use if we want make our code more dynamic and easier
